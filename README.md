# toolbox_engine
The toolbox engine is a c++ realtime engine

Things it does:
* runs on windows, mac and linux
* runs on old hardware
* has facilities for UI, sound, graphics, 3d shapes, lighting and networking
* functionality over beauty

Things it doesn't do:
* cater to non-programmers
* adds another scripting language on top

## TODO
* I want multiple options when it comes to what kind of toolbox engine you want eg:
* a version of the engine with no window (eg headless)
* a version without audio
* a version with networking
* I want to be able to select from the top level systems or something along those lines
